              Veer was amazed. But he felt that Dadaji had started talking about
              something else now. Getting impatient, he gently returned to the
              topic he wanted to discuss
            </p>
            <p>
              Veer - OK. But now we have been a free nation for more than 75
              years. What are we doing now?
            </p>
            <p>
              Dadaji- Yes. You are right. In the last ten years,India has made
              great progress in space exploration. We have become
              atmanirbhar(self-reliant) in all fields from sea to the space and
              talent to technology. India now holds the world record for sending
              104 satellites in just one day!
