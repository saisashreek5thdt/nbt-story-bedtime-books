                Veer - I know. I saw the satellites video on youtube. It was so
                interesting. Tell me Dadaji, what is so special about
                Chandrayaan 3?
              </p>
              <p>
                Dadaji - You have asked a very good question. I will explain in
                detail. Just then, Veer&apos;s mother entered the room with a
                tray with two glasses of hot milk for both of them. Dadaji took
                a sip.
              </p>
              <p>
                Veer adjusted his pillow to be even more comfortable. The milk
                was too hot for him. He would wait a bit to drink it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dadaji - The landing of Chandrayaan 3 is a matter of great pride
                for us because India is the first country to successfully land
                on the south pole of the moon. Our scientists have achieved it
                at a very low cost of 620 million dollars which is almost half
                the cost of a Hollywood movie.
