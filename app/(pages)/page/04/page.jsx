            Dadaji - Veer, it was a very great day in the history of Space
            research, as well as for India. Modiji has rightly named 23 August as
            National Space Day. But first let me tell you a small story about
            the moon which I heard from my grandmother when I was young.
          </p>
          <p>
            Veer - Wow! Tell me quickly, Dadaji.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dadaji - Once upon a time, a young princess wanted to go to the moon.
            The king  didn&apos;t know how to fulfil his daughter&apos;s foolish
            wish. He promised a huge reward for anyone who would please his daughter.
            Many courtiers came forward with various ideas but none could please the
            princess.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day, a saint came and took the challange.
            He asked the king to bring his daughter before him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Saint - Tell me, little one, how big is the moon?
          </p>
